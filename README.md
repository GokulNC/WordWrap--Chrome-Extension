## Word Wrap Selected TextArea -- Chrome Extension

### What does it do?
Whenever you select a block of text that you have typed and click on the WordWrap extension,
it will automagically word wrap the selected text for you!

Will be useful in scenarios where you want to introduce a character-limit per line.

### Features
- Default shorcut key to WordWrap: `Alt+Shift+B`
  - (Can also be changed from Chrome extension shorcuts)
- Extension Options (Right-click the extension icon)
  - Custom character limit per line
  - WordWrap all text if no selection
  - [Experimental] Support for WordWrap of ContentEditable sections (like Gmail compose)
